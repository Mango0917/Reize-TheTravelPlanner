                <h3>What is Body Mass Index?</h3>
                <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is used as a tool to indicate whether a person is underweight, overweight, obese or a healthy weight for their height.</p>
                <p>If a person's BMI is out of the healthy BMI range, their health risks may significantly increase.</p>
                <p>BMI values are irrespective of age and are the same for both sexes. However, BMI may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different populations due to different body proportions.</p>
                <p>The health risks associated with an increasing BMI are continuous, and the interpretation of BMI grading in relation to risk may differ for different populations.</p>
                <h3><a href="?page=2">Calculate your BMI here with our BMI Calculator</a></h3>
                <h3>Benefits of maintaining a healthy weight</h3>
                <p>The benefits of maintaining a healthy weight include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fewer joint and muscle pains</li>
                    <li>Increased energy and ability to join in more activities</li>
                    <li>Improved regulation of bodily fluids and blood pressure</li>
                    <li>Reduced burden on the heart and circulatory system</li>
                    <li>Improved sleep patterns</li>
                    <li>Reductions in blood triglycerides, blood glucose, and risk of developing type 2 diabetes</li>
                    <li>Reduced risk for heart disease and certain cancers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Excess weight increases how hard the heart has to work, it also raises blood pressure, blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels and lowers HDL (beneficial) cholesterol levels. Excess weight can make a person more likely to develop diabetes.</p>
                <p>Lifestyle changes that help you maintain a 3-5% weight loss are likely to result in clinically meaningful improvements in blood glucose, triglycerides and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater weight loss can also help reduce blood pressure and improve blood cholesterol.</p>
                <h3>BMI categories</h3>
                <p class="text-info">A BMI of less than 18.5 indicates that you are underweight, so you may need to put on some weight. You are recommended to ask your doctor or a dietitian for advice.</p>
                <p class="text-success">A BMI of 18.5-24.9 indicates that you are at a healthy weight for your height. By maintaining a healthy weight, you lower your risk of developing serious health problems.</p>
                <p class="text-warning">A BMI of 25-29.9 indicates that you are slightly overweight. You may be advised to lose some weight for health reasons. You are recommended to talk to your doctor or a dietitian for advice.</p>
                <p class="text-danger">A BMI of 30-39.5 indicates that you are heavily overweight, or obese. Your health may be at risk if you do not lose weight. You are recommended to talk to your doctor or a dietitian for advice.</p>
                <p style="color:#800517;">A BMI of 40 and above indicates that you are extremely obese. Your health is potentially at risk if you do not lose weight. It is highly recommended to talk to your doctor or dietitian for advice and consultation.</p>

                <h3>What is Basal Metabolic Rate</h3>
                <p>Basal metabolic rate, or BMR, is the measurement of energy an organism uses when at rest. In other words, when you're at rest, not digesting any food and at a comfortable temperature, BMR is the amount of energy it takes for your body to maintain life. About 70% of the energy we use every day is due to our organs functioning to keep us alive and healthy. The remaining 30% is broken down into digestion of food (10%) and energy needed for activity (20%).</p>
                <p>
                    Knowing your BMR can be useful if you're trying to gain or lose weight. Since BMR is a calculation of how much energy it takes to maintain life, consuming more kilocalories in a day than your BMR calls for can cause you to gain weight, while eating fewer kilocalories than your BMR requires is likely to cause you to lose weight. However, these numbers are also dependent upon how active you are. Since exercising burns calories, if you are very active, you will need more calories to sustain life than someone who is not active.</p?
                    <h3>Humans vs. Other Animals</h3>
                <p>A human's BMR is dependent upon several things, and one of the most notable is temperature. Mammals are endotherms, which means that we (since humans are mammals) maintain a constant body temperature, no matter what temperature it is outside. When we're cold, we shiver to get warm again, and when we're hot, we sweat to cool off. This regulation of temperature takes energy.</p>
                <p>Other organisms, known as ectotherms, allow their body temperature to change with their environment. When it's hot outside, these organisms are warm and active, and when it's cold outside, these organisms are cold and sluggish. A few examples of ectotherms are reptiles, fish, and insects. An advantage of being an ectotherm is it takes less energy to exist, but their BMR also changes depending on the temperature outside.</p>

                <h3><a href="?page=3">Calculate your BMR here with our BMR Calculator</a></h3>
                <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                <p>Knowing your basal metabolic rate is a great place to start when training for weight management. Regardless of how much weight you want to gain or lose, you should keep an eye on your BMR to make sure your body is receiving enough calories to function.</p>
                <p>
                    Consistently under-eating will affect your hearts ability to pump blood which can be dangerous.
                    The amount of exercise you do will affect how many calories you need, the more exercise you do the higher your BMR will be. Don't be tempted to eat less when you start training. You should maintain your BMR when possible, and re-calculate when your exercise or diet habits change.
                </p>
                <p>And with your BMR, you will be able to calculate how many calories you need daily, depending on your level of activity.</p>

                <h3>How Many Calories Do You Need?</h3>
                <p>Nearly all of us seek to lose weight, and often the best way to do this is to consume a lower amount of calories each day than we usually do. But how many calories do we need to be healthy? Much depends, of course, on the amount of physical activity you engage in each day. And it's different for us all; there are a lot of different factors involved.</p>
                <p>Factors include age, size, height, sex, lifestyle, and overall general health. A physically active, 25 year-old six-foot male requires considerably more calories than a five-foot 70-year-old woman who is not especially active. The average male adult requires about 2,700 calories to maintain his weight, while the average female needs only 2,200 calories, according to the U.S Department of Health.</p>
                <p>Just to stay alive, we obviously need far less calories, but our bodies will function poorly if we consume too few. The basal metabolic rate, used in our calculator, is the amount of energy you require when you are just resting. Depending on the amount of physical exercise you do, you can multiply the basal metabolic rate by a specific number to determine calorie needs.</p>
                <h3>Different Kinds of Calories</h3>
                <p>Did you know that how you eat can make a difference in terms of how many calories you consume? The longer you chew your food, the greater the amount of calories you absorb, a recent study has shown.</p>
                <p>Foods that take more effort to chew-like fruit, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains-make your body burn more calories. More calories are required to digest them, and, to top it off, they'll keep you feeling satisfied longer. Some other foods also increase calorie burn: Coffee and tea, for example, not only for the caffeine in them, but also for other ingredients they have. Certain spices like chilies, cinnamon, and ginger do also help to burn calories.</p>
                <p>Scientists have recently discovered that there is a difference in terms of gaining or losing weight in the quality of the calories you consume, not just the quantity. There is an actual difference in consuming 500 calories of carrots from 500 calories of popcorn - although technically you should be consuming the same amount of energy, the popcorn makes you fatter just the same.</p>
                <p>It turns out that a healthy diet, irrespective of quantities, will keep you thinner. The best thing is to eat at least five different fruits and vegetables with each meal. The process of converting these hard-to-chew foods into energy will have a healthy effect.</p>
                <h3>Drinking in Calories</h3>
                <p>We get a lot of our calories from drinks. On average, we take in about 21 percent of our calories from them. A drink sweetened with sugar can undo the effects of a long workout at the gym. What's more, we often drink right from the bottle, and that means we take in a lot more than we actually need.</p>
                <p>The best things to drink, from the point of view of limiting calorie intake, are water, and coffee or tea without sugar. However, few of us are willing to drink nothing else all the time. Fruit juice is a low-calorie drink as well, but be careful not to take too much. A six-ounce glass is a healthy serving, while a bigger glass means you'll take in more calories than you probably should.</p>
                <p>Many people, especially in America, also consume about 580 calories per day in unhealthy snacks. Nothing is worse from the point of view of calorie control, which is best maintained by regular healthy meals and little in between. Choose snacks carefully, and count the calories you are putting into your snacks. This can make a great difference in maintaining the right weight for your size.</p>
                <p>Don't be misled by "health food." "Natural" foods still may contain a lot of sugar, and low-calorie foods may have unhealthy ingredients replacing the calories. For example, many reduced-fat foods have sugar added instead. There is nothing wrong with eating "health" foods, but always find out what is in the packages before you buy.</p>
                <h3>Lose Weight Sensibly and Carefully</h3>
                <p>A proper weight for your size is definitely a healthy condition. But it won't be healthy if you cut down too sharply on calories, do too much exercise without eating properly, or take other extreme measures. Weight should always be lost gradually. Maintaining a healthy diet while you lose weight will just help the whole process along.</p>

                <p>Metabolic Rate is the rate at which the body burns up calories. A body that consumes 2500 calories a day, and burns 2500 calories a day will stay at the same weight. A body consuming 2500 calories daily but burning only 2000 will gain weight at the rate of about 0.5kg a week.</p>

                <h3>You burn calories to provide energy for three main functions:</h3>
                <h4>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</h4>
                <p>This is the amount of calories you burn just by being alive - even when you are lying down, doing nothing. BMR accounts for approximately 60% of the calories burned for an average person.</p>
                <h4>Burning Calories for Activity</h4>
                <p>This is the energy used during movement - from lifting your arm to operate the remote control to cleaning the windows. This accounts for approximately 30% of the calories burned by an average person.</p>
                <h4>Dietary Thermogenesis</h4>
                <p>The 'thermogenic effect' described as heat production from meals - the calories burned in the process of eating, digesting, absorbing and using food.</p>

                <p>Exercise is the physical exertion of the body - making the body do a physical activity which results in a healthy or healthier level of physical fitness and both physical and mental health.</p>
                <h3>Types of exercise</h3>
                <p>There are three broad intensities of exercise:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Light exercise - the exerciser is able to talk while exercising. Going for a walk is an example of light exercise.</li>
                    <li>Moderate exercise - the exerciser feels slightly out of breath during the session. Examples could be walking briskly, cycling moderately, or walking up a hill.</li>
                    <li>Vigorous exercise - the exerciser is panting during the activity. The exerciser feels his/her body is being pushed much nearer its limit, compared to the other two intensities. This could include running, cycling fast, and heavy weight training.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are three basic categories of exercise:<p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aerobic exercise</li>
                        <li>Anaerobic exercise</li>
                        <li>Agility training</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Aerobic exercise</h3>
                <p>Aerobic exercise has the aim of improving the body's consumption of oxygen. The word <em>aerobic</em> means "with oxygen." Aerobic refers to our body's use of oxygen in its metabolic process (process that generates energy). Most aerobic exercises are done at moderate levels of intensity for longer periods, compared to other categories of exercise.</p>
                <p>An aerobic exercise session involves warming up, exercising for at least 20 minutes, and then cooling down. Aerobic exercise involves mainly the large muscle groups. </p>
                <p>Aerobic exercise is generally performed at a moderate level of intensity over a long period. Running for 20 minutes is an aerobic exercise, while sprinting 200 meters is not. Playing badminton for 30 minutes is an aerobic activity if the movements of the players are fairly continuous. Golf, on the other hand, is not seen as aerobic because the heart rate has not been raised at a sustained level for long enough.</p>
                <h3>Anaerobic exercise</h3>

                Anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting can improve strength and muscle.
                <p>The aim of anaerobic exercise is to build power, strength, and muscle. The muscles are exercised at high intensity for short durations. A short duration often means no more than about two minutes.</p>
                <p>
                    The word <em>anaerobic</em> means "without air." Anaerobic exercises improve our muscle strength and our ability to move with quick bursts of speed. When thinking of anaerobic exercise, think of short and fast or short and intensive. Anaerobic exercises include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weight lifting</li>
                        <li>Sprinting</li>
                        <li>Intensive and fast skipping (with a rope)</li>
                        <li>Interval training</li>
                        <li>Isometrics</li>
                        <li>Any rapid burst of hard exercise.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Oxygen is not used for energy during anaerobic exercise. During this type of exercise a byproduct - lactic acid - is produced. Lactic acid contributes to muscle fatigue and must be used up during recovery before that muscle can be subjected to another anaerobic session.</p>
                <p>During the recovery period, oxygen is used to give the muscle a "refill" - to replenish the muscle's energy that was used up during the intensive exercise.</p>
                <p>In overall, anaerobic exercise uses up fewer calories than aerobic exercise. The cardiovascular benefits of aerobic exercises are greater than the cardiovascular benefits of anaerobic exercises. However, anaerobic exercise is better at building strength and muscle mass, while still benefitting the heart and lungs.</p>
                <p>As you build more muscle you will burn more fat, even at rest. Muscles burn more calories per unit volume than any other tissue in the body. A muscular person burns more calories than a non-muscular person, even if while he/she is resting.</p>
                <h3>Agility training</h3>
                <p>Agility training aims to improve a person's ability to speed up and slow down, change directions, while maintaining balance and control.</p>
                <p>In tennis, for example, agility training helps the player maintain control over his/her court positioning through good recovery after each shot.</p>
                <p>A crucial skill in tennis is to be able to position yourself in the court so that you can hit the ball to maximum effect. Agility does not only help the tennis player get to the ball more effectively and set up for a better shot, but it also gives him/her better balance in order to hit the ball.</p>
                <p>Agility training is practiced extensively by people who play certain sports where positioning, coordination, balance and the ability to suddenly change posture and speeds are essential.</p>
                <p>Agility and co-ordination are two key attributes for a successful soccer player. Such complex movements as dribbling, turning, passing, and intercepting require a wide assortment of balance, coordination and other skills, such as the ability to accelerate and decelerate quickly. A good soccer player also needs excellent special awareness and accurate timing.</p>
                <p>Soccer players often practice improving their ability to change the direction of the body abruptly, or shift stance without losing balance.</p>
                <p>Agility includes speed, strength, balance, and coordination. The following sports are known to require agility ( however there are many more than on this list):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tennis</li>
                    <li>Soccer</li>
                    <li>Rugby</li>
                    <li>American football</li>
                    <li>Squash</li>
                    <li>Hockey</li>

                <p>Some exercises include a combination of stretching, muscle strengthening, balance, etc. A good example is yoga.</p>
                <p>Many experts say stretching is an exercise of its own. Yoga exercises, or movements, improve your balance, flexibility, posture and circulation. Yoga originated in India a long time ago, and is aimed at unifying the mind, body and spirit. Modern yoga - the type of yoga practiced by most people in western countries - uses a combination of meditation, posture, and breathing exercises.</p>
                <p>Yoga can be tailored to meet the needs of individuals, such as those with arthritis, asthma, or certain body pains. Pilates is similar to yoga, but focuses more on the core abdominal and back muscles.</p>
                <h3>Why is Exercise Important?</h3>
                <p>Have you ever heard the expression "use it or lose it"? It's true! If you don't use your body, you will surely lose it, so to say. Your muscles will become flabby and weak. Your heart and lungs won't function efficiently. And your joints will be stiff and easily injured. Inactivity can be as much of a health risk as smoking!</p>
                <h4>Helps Prevent Diseases</h4>
                <p>Our bodies were meant to move; they actually crave exercise. Regular exercise is necessary for physical fitness and good health. It reduces the risk of heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and other diseases. It can improve your appearance and delay the body's aging process.</p>
                <h4>Improves Stamina</h4>
                <p>When you exercise, your body uses energy to keep going. Aerobic exercise involves continuous and rhythmic physical motion, such as walking and bicycling. It improves your stamina by training your body to become more efficient and use less energy for the same amount of work. As your conditioning level improves, your heart rate and breathing rate return to resting levels much sooner from strenuous activity.</p>
                <h4>Strengthens and Tones Your Body</h4>
                <p>Exercising with weights and other forms of resistance training develops your muscles, bones and ligaments for increased strength and endurance. Your posture can be improved, and your muscles become more firm and toned. Not only will you feel better, but you'll look better too!</p>
                <h4>Enhances Flexibility</h4>
                <p>Stretching exercises are also important for good posture. They keep your body pliable so that you can bend, reach and twist. Improving your flexibility through exercise reduces the chance of injury and improves balance and coordination. If you have stiff, tense areas, such as the upper back or neck, performing specific stretches can help "loosen" those muscles, helping you feel more relaxed.</p>
                <h4>Controls Weight</h4>
                <p>Exercise is also a key to weight control because it burns calories. If you burn off more calories than you take in, you lose weight. It's as simple as that.</p>
                <h3>How Often Should I Exercise?</h3>
                <p>The benefits of any exercise program will diminish if it's disrupted too frequently. A "stop-start" routine is not only ineffective, but can cause injuries. Being consistent with exercise, therefore, is probably the most important factor in achieving desired results.</p>
                <p>People often assume that more is better. Wrong! Doing too much too soon or performing intense exercises on a daily basis will have deleterious effects, such as muscle/tendon strains, loss of lean tissue, and fitness-level plateaus.</p>
                <h4>Cardio</h4>
                <p>If you are a beginner, start off slower than you think you should. Three days per week is realistic, safe and effective. If you are experienced, do cardiovascular (aerobic) exercises such as walking, jogging and bicycling for no more than 200 minutes per week with no more than 60 minutes per session.</p>
                <h4>Lifting Weights</h4>
                <p>Weight training should be done no more than three times per week targeting the same muscle groups. Exercise the same muscle groups on non-consecutive days because muscles need adequate time to recover and cannot be effectively trained if they are tired or sore.</p>
                <h4>Stretching</h4>
                <p>Many people forget to stretch or make the excuse that they don't have the time. Flexibility is important, so make the time! Stretching can be done every day, but stick to a minimum of three times per week in order to reap the benefits. When the body is warmed up, such as after a workout session, perform five to 10 stretches that target the major muscle groups. Hold each stretch for 10-30 seconds.</p>

                <p>Your heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute. You can measure your heart rate by feeling your pulse - the rhythmic expansion and contraction (or throbbing) of an artery as blood is forced through it by the regular contractions of the heart. It is a measure of how hard your heart is working.</p>

                            <div class="modal-body">
                                <img style="height:400px;width:100%" src="http://www.cardiachealth.org/sites/default/files/2011/pulse.gif" />
                                <p>Your pulse can be felt at the wrist, neck, groin or top of the foot - areas where the artery is close to the skin. However usually, people measure their pulse in their wrist. This is called the radial pulse.</p>
                                <h5>Your Pulse</h5>
                                <p>Taking your pulse is easy. It requires no special equipment, however, a watch with a second hand or digital second counter is very helpful.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Turn the palm side of your hand facing up.</li>
                                    <li>Place your index and middle fingers of your opposite hand on your wrist, approximately 1 inch below the base of your hand.</li>
                                    <li>Press your fingers down in the grove between your middle tendons and your outside bone. You should feel a throbbing - your pulse.</li>
                                    <li>Count the number of beats for 10 seconds, then multiply this number by 6. This will give you your heat rate for a minute.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h5>Example:</h5>
                                <p>
                                    If you count <strong>11 beats</strong> in the span of <strong>10 seconds</strong>, multiply <strong>11 X 6 = 66</strong>.
                                    This means your heart rate or pulse, is 66 (beats per minute).
                                    Another popular way to measure pulse rate is by measuring it at the neck (carotid pulse). This is especially convenient during exercise. The formula is the same as above, however, when taking the pulse at the neck, place your fingertips gently on one side of your neck, below your jawbone and halfway between your main neck muscles and windpipe:

                                    <figcaption>Taking your pulse upon rising in the morning, or after sitting without activity for about 10 minutes, is know as your Resting Heart Rate.</figcaption>

                <h3>Normal Heart Rate</h3>
                <p>Your normal heart rate anywhere in the range of 60 to 100 is considered to be in the normal range. Your heart rate will fluctuate a lot depending on factors such as your activity level and stress level. If however, your pulse is consistently above 90, you should consult your physician. This condition is called <strong>tachycardia</strong> (increased heart rate).</p>
                <p>Many athletes have heart rates in the range of 40 to 60, depending on how fit they are. In general, a lower heart rate (or pulse) is good. Sometimes however, one's heart rate can be too low. This is known as <strong>bradycardia</strong> (decreased heart rate) and can be dangerous, especially when blood pressure gets too low as well. Symptoms include weakness, loss of energy and fainting. If this situation applies, you should seek medical attention immediately.</p>
                <p>If the pattern of beats or throbs you count is irregular (i. e. a beat is missed) take your pulse for a full minute. If you experience irregularities in your pulse on a consistent basis, you should consult your physician.</p>
                <p>Many factors influence heart rate. These include emotions, temperature, your position or posture (sitting, standing, laying down), and your body size (if you are overweight for your size, your heart will have to work harder to supply energy to your body).</p>
                <h3>Reducing Your Heart Rate</h3>
                <p>A decrease in resting heart rate is one of the benefits of increased fitness due to exercise. If you have heart rate issues, such as irregular heart beats, before starting any exercise , be sure to consult your physician.</p>
                <p>Your heart is a muscle and will respond just like any skeletal muscle in that it will become stronger through conditioning. If your heart muscles are stronger, then your heart rate will decrease. In other words, your heart will be putting out less effort to pump the same amount of blood.</p>
